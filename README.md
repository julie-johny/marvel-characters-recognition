# marvel-characters-recognition
This is a face-recognition system which can be used to identify characters in any Marvel movie.

'data' folder contains images of all the characters. 'names' file contains the names of characters according to the files in data folder.
Python code encodes the recognised images and checks for similarity. 

Increasing the number of pictures and reducing the tolerance can imrove accuracy.
